# Technical-Interview

These are the Tasks required for the completion of the Technical Interview

## Instructions to get started

1) Fork this repositiory into your own **private** repo
2) Create a branch off main titled `dev`
3) For the duration of the tasks below, commit changes to the `dev` branch and only create a pull request when you completed one of the tasks
4) Once you are happy with your completed task, accept and merge your pull request into the main branch

## Task 1 - Python basics

**Make sure to commit all changes as you work through the task with meaniful descriptive commit messages**

*Note: Please feel free to add any extra files or special features to your script! We love to see cool things that people can do!*

1) Open the `Python` folder and create a new file called `task1.py`
2) Create a simple script that incorporates the following objectives
    -  Takes user input
    -  Makes an API call
    -  Parses the response of the API call
    -  Returns something to the user
    -  All potential errors accounted for (no exceptions thrown)

This could be something as easy as asking a user for their favorite dog then utilizing a public free-to-use dog API to return facts about the dog that they inputted. Once agian feel free to get creative and make it as complex as possible. Since this is a fairly easy task, we are looking for some really impressive creations!
