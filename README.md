# Technical-Interview

These are the Tasks required for the completion of the Technical Interview

## Instructions to get started

1) Fork this repositiory into your own **private** repo (Ensure the repo is **Private**)
2) Create a branch off main titled `dev`
3) For the duration of the tasks below, commit changes to the `dev` branch and only create a pull request when you completed one of the tasks
4) Once you are happy with your completed task, accept and merge your pull request into the main branch

## Task 1 - Python basics

**Make sure to commit all changes often as you work through the task with meaniful descriptive commit messages**

*Note: Please feel free to add any extra files or special features to your script, we love to see cool things that people can do! Also make sure to create several comments throughout the code to explain your thought process*

1) Open the `Task 1` folder inside the `Python` folder and create a new file called `task1.py` (Feel free to create additional files if you need them)
2) Create a simple script that incorporates the following objectives
    -  Takes user input
    -  Makes an API call
    -  Parses the response of the API call
    -  Returns something to the user
    -  All potential errors accounted for (no exceptions thrown)

This could be something as easy as asking a user for their favorite dog then utilizing a public free-to-use dog API to return facts about the dog that they inputted. Once agian feel free to get creative and make it as complex as possible. Since this is a fairly easy task, we are looking for some really impressive creations!

**Make sure to commit all changes as you work through the task with meaniful descriptive commit messages**

*Note: Please feel free to add any extra files or special features to your script, we love to see cool things that people can do! Also make sure to create several comments throughout the code to explain your thought process*
